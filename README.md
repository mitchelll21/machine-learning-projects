# Machine Learning Projects from Wake Forest MSBA courses
The R markdown files in this repository are the final products and models created for the machine learning course at Wake Forest.
These projects were theoretically collaborative but all work is my own.
These projects all earned an 'A' grade. In addition to building the models, we competed against each other in weekly Kaggle competitions.
I scored in the Top 10 of 140 submissions in two competitions: XGBoost and Random Forest project 1 and the MLP, XGBoost, Random Forest digit identification project
